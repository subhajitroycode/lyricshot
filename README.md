# Overview

I got the idea of this project from a Pinterest post then I thought of making it a web application. Here you can search any songs (obviously that has to be on the spotify server) and then you can create a picture of your lyrics. [Click here](https://lyricshot.netlify.app/)  to see it in action. 

## My Process

### Built with

* HTML
* SASS/SCSS
* JavaScript
* API's

## The Challenge

Now the challenge is to make this responsive and mobile friendly and also to make it look nice. I also have to call two APIs the first one is to search the song and the second one is to fetch the lyrics of the song.

## Issues

There is some issues that I don't know how to fix it yet. Like I wanted a download button that can convert the html to beautiful picture and I used some libraries like html2canvas, domtoimage but in every cases either the rendering isn't good or there is issues with browser compatibility.

## What I Learned

I learned how to use the API's and how to use the libraries that I used. I also learned how to make SASS and JS more modular and reusable. I also learned how to make the vertical scrollbar hidden but still scrollable.
